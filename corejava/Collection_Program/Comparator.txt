Comparator:

*.it is present in java.util package.
*.it defines two methods 
    1)public int compare(Object obj1,Object obj2)
     *.return -ve iff obj1 has to come before obj2.
     *.return +ve iff obj1 has to come after obj2 . 
     *.return 0 iff obj1 and obj2  are equals.

    2)public boolean equals(Object obj)

*.whenever we are "comparator" interface  compulsory we should provide implementation only for "compare()"
 method and we are not required provied implentation for "equals()" method because it is already avialable
 to our class from "Object" class through  inheritance.

write a program to insert int object into to "TreeSet" where the sorting order is decending order.
